### **Analysis of the Improved Trie Algorithm**

#### 1. **Time Complexity**

##### **a. Inserting a String (`addString`)**
- The insertion process iterates through the characters of the input string.
- Let `L` be the length of the string, then:
  - Each character is processed in \(O(1)\) due to the hash map used for children.
  - Total complexity: **\(O(L)\)** for one string.
- For inserting `N` strings with an average length \(L\):
  - Total complexity: **\(O(N \cdot L)\)**.

##### **b. Autocomplete Suggestions (`autoComplete`)**
- The `autoComplete` method has two main steps:
  1. Traversing the Trie to locate the node corresponding to the prefix.
     - Complexity: \(O(P)\), where \(P\) is the length of the prefix.
  2. Performing a **weighted BFS** to gather all possible completions:
     - The BFS visits all descendant nodes of the prefix node.
     - Let \(M\) be the number of descendant nodes, and \(C\) be the total characters in their paths.
     - Traversing and processing all nodes takes \(O(M + C)\).
     - Using a priority queue for ranking adds a log factor for each insertion, \(O(M \cdot \log(M))\).

  - Total complexity for `autoComplete`: **\(O(P + M \cdot \log(M) + C)\)**.

##### **c. User Selection Update (`userSelected`)**
- Traversing the Trie to update weights for the selected string.
- Let \(L\) be the length of the selected string:
  - Complexity: \(O(L)\).

##### **d. Deletion (`deleteString`)**
- Deleting a string requires traversing its path in the Trie and potentially cleaning up unused nodes.
- Let \(L\) be the length of the string:
  - Complexity: \(O(L)\) for traversal and node deletions.

##### **e. Reading Data from File (`readDataFromFile`)**
- Each line of the file is inserted into the Trie.
- Let \(N\) be the number of lines and \(L\) the average length of a line:
  - Total complexity: \(O(N \cdot L)\).

#### 2. **Space Complexity**

##### **a. Trie Structure**
- Each node stores:
  1. A hash map for its children, which can use \(O(|\Sigma|)\) memory, where \(|\Sigma|\) is the alphabet size.
  2. Two integers (`exist` and `cnt`) and a weight.

- For a dataset with \(N\) strings of average length \(L\):
  - The Trie may have up to \(N \cdot L\) nodes (in the worst case, each character in each string forms a unique node).
  - Each node uses \(O(|\Sigma|)\) space for the hash map.
  - Total space: **\(O(N \cdot L \cdot |\Sigma|)\)** in the worst case.

##### **b. BFS for Autocomplete**
- The BFS queue can grow up to the size of the Trie subtree corresponding to the prefix.
- Let \(M\) be the number of descendant nodes:
  - Queue memory: \(O(M)\).
  - Priority queue for weighted ranking: \(O(M)\).
  - Total space: **\(O(M)\)** for BFS.

##### **c. User Preferences (`userPreference`)**
- The map tracks weights for each string selected by the user.
- Let \(U\) be the number of unique strings selected by users:
  - Memory used: **\(O(U)\)**.

| Operation               | Time Complexity                  | Space Complexity                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Insert (`addString`)** | \(O(L)\) per string, \(O(N \cdot L)\) for \(N\) strings | \(O(N \cdot L \cdot |\Sigma|)\)     |
| **Autocomplete**         | \(O(P + M \cdot \log(M) + C)\)   | \(O(M)\)                         |
| **User Selection Update**| \(O(L)\)                         | \(O(U)\)                         |
| **Deletion**             | \(O(L)\)                         | \(O(N \cdot L \cdot |\Sigma|)\) (after insertion) |
| **File Read**            | \(O(N \cdot L)\)                 | \(O(N \cdot L \cdot |\Sigma|)\)     |

### **Optimizations**

1. **Space Efficiency**
   - If the dataset uses only lowercase English letters (\(26\) characters), replacing `std::unordered_map` with `std::array` reduces memory overhead.

2. **Weighted Ranking**
   - Weights are dynamically updated, allowing adaptive performance based on user behavior.

3. **Scalability**
   - The algorithm efficiently scales for large datasets with millions of entries due to the logarithmic factor in suggestion ranking.
